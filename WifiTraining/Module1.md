## Q1) In which OSI layer the Wi-Fi standard/protocol fits.

### Wi-Fi Standard in the OSI Model
The Wi-Fi standard (IEEE 802.11) fits into the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model.
1. Physical Layer (Layer 1):  
This layer deals with the actual transmission of data over the air using radio waves. It defines:
	 - 	**Modulation Techniques:** OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum), etc.
 	- 	**Frequency Bands:** 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz.
 	 - **Channel Widths:** 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, 160 MHz.
  	- 	**Data Rates:** Varies based on the Wi-Fi standard (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax).
The Physical Layer is responsible for converting digital data into radio signals and vice versa.
2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):  
 - **Logical Link Control (LLC) Sublayer**
	 - Handles flow control and error checking.
	 - Ensures that data is correctly framed before transmission.
 - **Media Access Control (MAC) Sublayer**   
  	- Defines how devices access the wireless medium.  
	- Uses protocols like Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to prevent collisions.  
	- Manages MAC addresses, authentication, and encryption (WPA, WPA2, WPA3).  
The Data Link Layer ensures proper data framing, addressing, and error detection for wireless communication.

|OSI Layer|	Role in Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)|
|----|------------|
|Layer 1 (Physical Layer)|	Modulation, radio frequencies, transmission, reception |
|Layer 2 (Data Link Layer - MAC & LLC)|	Media access, authentication, encryption, addressing |
  
Thus we can say that Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) primarily operates in the Physical Layer (Layer 1) and Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. The Physical Layer manages radio wave transmission, while the Data Link Layer controls access, authentication, and encryption.

## Q2) Can you share the Wi-Fi devices that you are using day to day life, share that deviceâ€™s wireless capability/properties after connecting to network. Match your device to corresponding Wi-Fi Generations based on properties.

Some common wifi devices  that we use in day to day life include routers, smartphones, laptop, smart TVs. Some properties of these devices are:

|Device	Wi-Fi Standard|	Wi-Fi Generation|	Frequency |  Bands	|Max Speed|
|---------------|-------|-------------|---|--|
|Smartphone (S22)	|802.11ax|	Wi-Fi 6 / 6E|	2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz	|9.6 Gbps|
|Laptop (XPS 15)	|802.11ac|	Wi-Fi 5|	2.4 GHz, 5 GHz	|3.5 Gbps|
|Smart TV	|802.11n|	Wi-Fi 4|	2.4 GHz, 5 GHz	|600 Mbps|
|Wi-Fi Router (AX6000)|	802.11ax|	Wi-Fi 6|	2.4 GHz, 5 GHz	|6 Gbps|
|Smart Home Device|	802.11n|	Wi-Fi 4|	2.4 GHz	|300 Mbps|

Some routers these days provide 6GHz frequency since they are of Wifi 6e generations.

## Q3) What is BSS and ESS?
### Basic Service Set (BSS)
#### Definition:
A Basic Service Set (BSS) is the fundamental building block of a Wi-Fi network. It consists of a single access point (AP) and the associated wireless client devices (stations or group of stations i.e STAs).
#### Types of BSS:
 - Infrastructure BSS:
	 - Involves a Wi-Fi access point (AP) that manages communication between devices.
	 - Devices (clients) must connect to the AP to communicate.
	 - Used in homes, offices, and public Wi-Fi networks.
	 - Identified by a Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID), which is the MAC address of the AP.

 - Independent BSS (IBSS) (Ad-hoc Mode):
	 - No access point is involved.
	 - Devices communicate directly with each other in a peer-to-peer manner.
	 - Used in small setups like file sharing between laptops.
#### Example of BSS:
A home Wi-Fi network with a router (AP) and multiple devices (laptop, smartphone, TV) connecting to it.
### Extended Service Set (ESS)
#### Definition:
An Extended Service Set (ESS) consists of multiple BSSs connected together using a wired network (LAN). It allows seamless roaming between access points while staying connected to the same network.
#### Characteristics of ESS:
 - 	Multiple access points (APs) are used to extend coverage.
 - 	Devices can roam between APs while maintaining connectivity.
 - 	All APs in the ESS share the same SSID (Wi-Fi network name) but have different BSSIDs (MAC addresses of APs).
 - 	Common in large buildings, universities, malls, and corporate offices.
#### Example of ESS:
A university Wi-Fi network where students can move from one building to another while staying connected to the same network without disconnecting.

## Q4) What are the basic functionalities of Wi-Fi Accesspoint?
A Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) is a networking device that enables wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi. It acts as a central hub for wireless communication and extends network coverage.
### Key Functions of a Wi-Fi Access Point
1. Wireless Connectivity

7. Bandwidth & Traffic Management
 	- 	Uses band steering to move devices between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands for optimal performance.
 	- 	Supports load balancing to distribute network traffic across multiple APs.
8. Multiple SSID & VLAN Support

9. Mesh Networking (for Seamless Coverage)
 	- 	Some modern APs support Wi-Fi Mesh networks, where multiple APs work together to provide seamless coverage without dead zones.
10. Power over Ethernet (PoE) Support
 	- 	Many enterprise APs use PoE to receive power and data over a single Ethernet cable, reducing the need for additional power sources.
